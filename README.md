# Bamazon AKA The Moogle Shop
A simple CLI Storefront

## What does it do?
Running this app using Node allows the user to peruse a number of (final) fantastical wares, and choose how many of them to purchase.

If there are not enough of the wares, an error message will appear. If sufficient items are available, then the user will see the total cost and return to the store front after seeing an updated item list.

This app utilizes Node and a MySQL database to track sales and inventory.

## Tech Used
- Node
    - Inquirer for user input
    - Console Table for data formatting
- MySQL

## Demo

## Issues
1. I wasn't sure how to format the console table without including the headers each time.
